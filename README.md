# Interactive Dashboard for Feature Exploration, and Machine Learning for Target Prediction

For this data challenge, I have been provided 9 datasets that were generated from lab tests. The goal of the project is to deploy and tune machine learning algorithms that predict the result of the tests. The features in the datasets are not explicitly named, so an interactive dashboard is created for data exploration, to improve my understanding of the features.
