# Interactive Dashboard for Feature Exploration, and Machine Learning for Target Prediction

For this data challenge, I have been provided 9 datasets that were generated from lab tests. The goal of the project is to deploy and tune machine learning algorithms that predict the result of the tests. The features in the datasets are not explicitly named, so an interactive dashboard is created for feature exploration.

## Project Deliverable

Viewers can see my findings here:

- **workflow.ipynb:** A version of my workflow which contains plots has been rendered to nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OmereGithub/interactivedashboard/blob/master/workflow.ipynb). The Notebook also contains the link to the interactive dashboard, reveals all data analysis, deployed machine learning algorithms, and final results

## Starter File

Provided files that allowed me carry out this project: 

- **/datasets:** This folder contains the 9 datasets that were generated from lab test

## Created File

Created file that supports data exploration: 

- **app2.py:** This file contains code that was used to develop and deploy the interactive dashboard
